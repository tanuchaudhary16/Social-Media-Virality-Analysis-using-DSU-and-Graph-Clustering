# Social-Media-Virality-Analysis-using-DSU-and-Graph-Clustering
Analyzing Social Media Virality with Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) and Graph Clustering
This project provides a graph-based analytical system to study how content becomes viral on social media platforms. It represents user interactions as a network of nodes and edges and uses the Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) algorithm to efficiently detect communities within large-scale social networks. A simulation engine models how viral content spreads through these clusters based on connectivity and engagement patterns.

The system is built using Python, Streamlit, NetworkX, and MongoDB, and includes:
i)Community detection using Union-Find with path compression
ii)Graph clustering and visualization of user interaction networks
iii)Metrics such as total users, total connections, number of clusters, and largest cluster size
iv)Real-time visualizations including network graphs, bar charts, and bubble charts
v)An interactive dashboard for uploading datasets and exploring virality behavior
vi)Support for both synthetic and real-world social media datasets

This project offers a scalable and intuitive framework for analyzing viral trends, identifying influential user communities, and understanding how information spreads across social networks, making it useful for digital marketing, trend prediction, and misinformation analysis.
